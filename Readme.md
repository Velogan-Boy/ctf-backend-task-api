# CEG Tech Forum - Techops Student Director Recruitment 2023-24

## Task #1 - Backend Development

Get your hands dirty (try not to use any wrapper modules like passport) and create a web application
with simple sign-up, sign-in functionality.

-  Sign-up must have email confirmation feature
-  Forgot password feature using email as recovery
-  Two factor authentication (do not use SMS)
   -- Think of and create a simple authenticator.
   -- Example: Via WhatsApp / Telegram / Googleâ€™s 2FA. (Anything other than SMS)
-  Race conditions are to be avoided, i.e. only one user can login at a time, and only one
   session must be active.

-  Provide documentation for all the API routes with all necessary details.
-  Push your code and documentation (or doc links) to GitHub/GitLab.
